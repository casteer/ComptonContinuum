# ComptonContinuum

A short python code to plot the shape of Compton continuum based on the Klein-Nishina cross-section.

Run this from a linux terminal using the command _python ComptonContinuum.py_. Feel free to have a go with changing the gamma-ray energy and the detector resolution. 

n.b. All energies are in keV. 

Hope you find it useful!
